Files for final product in Algorithm folder:
- Algorithm2.py
- arima.py

Testing files:
- ArimaCpy is modified for backtesting
- arimaMain is used to run the integrated algorithm
- main only runs algorithm2

Henry's thought process:
- modify arima.py to save the graph png locally, easy to call this from HTML
